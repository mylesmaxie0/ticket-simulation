<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<h3 align="center">Intake</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Ken submits a request or report about an issue or inquiry through the help desk system, initiating the ticketing process. The ticket is generated with relevant details, such as the user's information, the issue description, and priority level, and is queued for review and further action.

<h3 align="center">Ticket assignment</h3>
<br />
<p>
  John Doe, a support agent, accesses the help desk system by logging into his account. Once logged in, he gains access to the ticket queue and begins reviewing incoming tickets, including the one created by User Ken, to begin the process of resolution.

<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Communication</h3>
<br />
<p>
Upon reviewing the ticket, Agent John recognizes that it is a Sev-A (Severity-A) emergency, which requires immediate attention from a higher-level technician. John reassigns the ticket to a System Administrator, ensuring that the issue is escalated and addressed by the appropriate team for faster resolution.
</p>
<p>
  Before reassigning the ticket, Agent John adds a detailed note in the ticket, providing context for the urgency. The message might look like this:

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Working the issue</h3>
<br />
<p>
Jane Doe, the System Administrator, logs into the help desk system. After logging in, she checks her assigned tickets and sees the reassigned Sev-A emergency ticket from Agent John. She reviews the details, including the message left by John, and prepares to address the critical issue promptly.
</p>

</p>
<p>
 Agent Jane begins troubleshooting and resolving the Sev-A emergency ticket. Once she addresses the problem, she updates the ticket with her findings and resolution steps. 
</p>
<p>
  She also makes sure to switch the issue's status from open to resolved.

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Resolution</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Support agent John sees in his portal that System Administrator agent Jane has left him a message and that the ticket is now closed!
</p>

<p>
  This was a very simplistic scenario of the creation of a ticket by a user, how the ticket is assigned and displays the communication of a ticket between agents; subsequently resulting in a resolution.
</p>
<p>
  There are additional scenarios that can also happen while a ticket is being assessed. A ticket can either be reassigned to a different department, escalated in severeity level, or needs to be both reassigned to a more qualified agent/department to handle the issue, depending on business impacts.
